Run query.py

The code will ask for a username and password, these can be anything for right now.
After asking for your food likes, it will query for "pizza" and return 5 jpeg file names which are contained in the Yelp Dataset, as well as their cosine scores.
We have listed the photo file names in test_photos.txt instead of uploading a large amount of pictures.
